# Autonomous-Obstacle-Detector-Robot
The Robot can detect and dodge the obstacle in its path automatically. It does not need any human interruption after being turned on. It's LED glows as it detects any obstruction and it activates its buzzer which symbolizes that it has detected an obstacle, then it calculates the available distance in its left and right direction while doing so, it turns its head in both the direction with the help of servo motor. After that, the robot turns and move in the direction where the available free space is more. Thus, it does not collide with any obstruction and keep moving without any problem.

## Information:
The pin number for the Arduino UNO board is clearly mentioned in the code with comments for better understanding.
